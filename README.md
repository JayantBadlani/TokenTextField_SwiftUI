# TokenTextField_SwiftUI
A token field is a type of text field that can convert text into tokens that are easy to select and manipulate similar to ios Mail app.

For example, Mail uses token fields for the address fields in the compose window. As people enter recipients, Mail converts the text that represents each recipientâ€™s name into a token. People can select these recipient tokens and perform operations like delete.
